# [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025)

My goal this year it so solve all challenges in Python. I want the runtime of each solution to be as short as possible, within reason. Python isn't exactly super fast so this will favor algorithmically efficient approaches. No external libraries will be used.

## Day 01: \*\*

Rotary dial combination. Count number of times the dial pointed at zero, or crossed zero.

Part 1: `10 ms`

Part 2: `10 ms`


## Day 02: \*\*

Look for numerical IDs with patterns like 6464 or 123123, or 777, etc.

Part 1: `10 ms`

Part 2: `1880 ms` (Python 3.12.11) / `342 ms` (PyPy 7.3.19)

Part 2 redux: `161 ms` (Python 3.12.11) / `25 ms` (PyPy 7.3.19)
